Mood-Based Note Generator
Inputs: A number (1-10, representing intensity) and a mood word (e.g., "happy," "calm").
Interaction: Retrieves an image that represents the chosen mood and intensity (e.g., "happy + 10" → a bright festival scene, "calm + 2" → a subtle, misty lake).
Surprise Factor: Extreme values (1 or 10) may yield unexpected results.
User Understanding: Provide a small scale (1 = low, 10 = high) and examples of moods.

- Based on the mood, the website outputs a note/reminder for the person.
